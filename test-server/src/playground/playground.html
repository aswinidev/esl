                      <p>Those sorts of questions aren’t asked by mathematicians, who are the people who derive
                        equations to
                        solve problems in a general way. Rather, they are asked by working engineers, technicians,
                        military
                        ballistics officers, and financiers, all of whom need an actual number: Given this set of
                        inputs,
                        tell me the answer.</p>
