                <p>At the current rate of rainfall, when will your local reservoir overflow its banks? If you shoot a
                  rocket at an angle of 60 degrees into a headwind, how far will it fly with 40 pounds of propellant
                  and a 5-pound payload? Assuming a 100-month loan for $75,000 at 5.11 percent, what will the payoff
                  balance be after four years? If a lab culture is doubling every 14 hours, how many viruses will
                  there be in a week?</p>
                <p>Those sorts of questions aren’t asked by mathematicians, who are the people who derive equations to
                  solve problems in a general way. Rather, they are asked by working engineers, technicians, military
                  ballistics officers, and financiers, all of whom need an actual number: Given this set of inputs,
                  tell me the answer.
