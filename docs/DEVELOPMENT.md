## Setup the project

To start the development you will need Node.js version 10+.

After cloning the repo, run:
```commandline
npm run start
```
to start development server with watch feature ootb.

You can create prod output assets in any moment using
```commandline
npm run build
```

To be sure that all validation checks passing before your commit and push your changes,
please make sure you allow `husky` to set up git hooks for your.

## Project Stack

ESL codebase written using TypeScript and LESS CSS-preprocessor.

ESL use the following tools to keep code base quality
- ES Lint to lint scripts
- StyleLint to lint styles
- Jest to run unit tests
- CommitLint to check commit message format

The 11ty project and webpack are used to build static website for project representation.

The semantic-release project and GitHub actions are used to automate the release process.

## Project Structure



## Project Scripts

- `npm start` or `npm run start` - start demo server locally.
  Runs local build, watch and browsersync.
  Uses `:3005` port by default.


- `npm run clean` - clear output folders
- `npm run build` - build project to ESM output
- `npm run build-pages` - build project autogenerated GitHub Pages


- `npm test` or `npm run test` - run linters and tests (silent task, used in CI/CD)
- `npm run lint` - run linting
- `npm run test:unit` - run all tests
- `npm run test:report` - run tests and create coverage report


## Update demo pages

The demo site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) - a simple static site generator.

[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) are picked as template languages.

The project is deployed to GitHub Pages using a GitHub workflow.


### Syntax highlighting for IDE

In case you are using JetBrains IDE (IDEA or WebStorm) you need to follow these steps:
1. Add [Twig Support plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7303-twig) if necessary
2. Go to File -> Settings -> Editor -> File Types
3. Find Twig and add the custom pattern `*.njk`.
   Now all *.njk files are parsed as Twig so you have support for Nunjucks.

For Visual Studio Code you can use this [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ronnidc.nunjucks) to support syntax highlighting.
